This repository is is buid for purpose of compiler algorithms mostly lexical analyser and syntactic parser.
For lexical analyser we can define reguler expression along with a DFA to analyse a string.
For syntactic parser, it can be divided into mainly to catgories. Top down parser and Bottom up parser.
